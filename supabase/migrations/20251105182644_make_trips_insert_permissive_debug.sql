/*\n  # Temporarily Make Trips INSERT More Permissive for Debugging\n\n  ## Problem\n  The INSERT policy is returning 403 Forbidden, which means:\n  1. User IS authenticated (otherwise it would be 401)\n  2. The RLS policy check is failing\n\n  ## Debug Strategy\n  Temporarily make the policy extremely permissive to isolate the issue.\n  Once we confirm the insert works, we can add constraints back.\n\n  ## Changes\n  1. Drop existing INSERT policy\n  2. Create a very permissive policy that allows any authenticated user to insert\n  3. This will help us determine if the problem is with auth.uid() or something else\n*/\n\n-- Drop existing INSERT policy\nDROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_can_create_trips" ON public.trips;
\nDROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create trips" ON public.trips;
\n\n-- Create extremely permissive INSERT policy for debugging\n-- This allows ANY authenticated user to insert a trip with ANY owner_id\nCREATE POLICY "debug_authenticated_can_insert_trips"\n  ON public.trips\n  FOR INSERT\n  TO authenticated\n  WITH CHECK (true);
\n\n-- Note: This is intentionally insecure for debugging purposes\n-- We will restrict it properly once we confirm the issue\n;
